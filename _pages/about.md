I am a third-year Master’s student majoring in Computational Linguistics at [Beijing Normal University](https://www.bnu.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Renfen Hu](http://irishu.cn/). Prior to this, I obtained my bachelor’s degree in Chinese Language and Literature from [Soochow University](https://www.suda.edu.cn/) in 2023, supervised by [Liulin Zhang](https://www.liulinzhang.com/). Also, I completed a Micro-credential in Intelligent Computing and Frontier Applications at [Soochow University](https://www.suda.edu.cn/) in 2023.

My primary interests lie at the intersection of Computational Linguistics and Cognitive Science, with a particular emphasis on meaning in both machines and humans. On the one hand, I aim to explore how cognitive theories and findings can be leveraged to evaluate and analyze AI systems, as well as to design AI systems with greater cognitive plausibility in terms of both data and mechanisms, ultimately leading to improved model performance or more efficient training. On the other hand, I seek to employ computational methods to better understand human language comprehension and production, particularly the conceptual networks and knowledge representation in the human brain.

I have also worked on NLP for language and culture, with a strong interest in developing language analysis tools that can support applications in various domains. 

I have completed three language-related internships, including Algorithm Engineer (NLP) at [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/en-us/), Linguistic Specialist at [ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/en/products), and AI Strategy Product Manager (TTS) at [Xiaomi](https://ir.mi.com/corporate-information/company-profile).

Outside of academics, I enjoy practicing karate and taking walks in nature.
