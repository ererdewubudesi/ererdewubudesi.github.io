I am a third-year Master’s student majoring in Computational Linguistics at [Beijing Normal University](https://english.bnu.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Renfen Hu](http://irishu.cn/). Prior to this, I obtained my bachelor’s degree in Chinese Language and Literature from [Soochow University](https://eng.suda.edu.cn/) in 2023, supervised by [Liulin Zhang](https://www.liulinzhang.com/). Also, I completed a Micro-credential in Intelligent Computing and Frontier Applications at [Soochow University](https://eng.suda.edu.cn/) in 2023.

<!-- My primary interests lie at **the intersection of Computational Linguistics and Cognitive Science**. I am deeply curious about **meaning in both machines and humans**, with a particular emphasis on **how non-textual information interacts with language to contribute to meaning**. On the one hand, I aim to explore how cognitive theories and findings involving perception and action can be leveraged to evaluate and analyze AI systems, as well as to design AI systems with greater cognitive plausibility in terms of both data and mechanisms, ultimately leading to improved model performance or more efficient training. On the other hand, I seek to employ computational methods to better understand human language, particularly the conceptual networks and knowledge representation in the human brain. -->

<!-- I have also worked on NLP for language and cultural studies, with a strong interest in **developing language analysis tools** that can support applications in various domains.  -->

My main research interests lie at **the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP), linguistics, and cognitive science**.  I am deeply curious about meaning in both machines and humans, with a particular emphasis on **how non-textual information interacts with language to contribute to meaning**.  

I am working on and interested in questions such as the following:

**Linguistics and Cognitive Science → NLP**
- How to evaluate and analyze AI systems by leveraging cognitive theories and findings concerning perception, embodiment, and social interaction and linguistics throies concerning semantics and pragmantic [[EMNLP findings 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16924)]
- How AI systems can achieve better language understanding through grounding  
- How to design more efficient AI systems with greater cognitive plausibility by leveraging multimodal data and multimodal training approaches

**NLP → Linguistics and Cognitive Science**  
- What AI systems can tell us about human conceptual organization and knowledge representation  
- What cognitively plausible AI systems can reveal about language acquisition

I have also worked on **NLP for language and cultural studies**, and I am broadly interested in:
- developing useful tools to quantify linguistic features  
- applying NLP methods to support cultural studies


I have completed three **language-related** internships, including NLP Algorithm Engineer for AI Safety at [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/en-us/), Linguistic Specialist at [ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/en/products), and AI Strategy Product Manager (TTS) at [Xiaomi](https://ir.mi.com/corporate-information/company-profile).

Outside of academics, I enjoy practicing karate and taking walks in nature.
