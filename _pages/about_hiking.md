I deeply enjoy my closeness to nature, which brings me a profound sense of inner peace. 

I love the hours spent gazing from a mountaintop and am often captivated by the flowers, trees, and wildlife along the way. All of this makes me feel how vibrantly alive life is. 

At times the journey to the destination is tough, but I am amazed by my own resilience.
