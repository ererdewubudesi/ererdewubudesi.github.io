I have been practicing karate ðŸ¥‹ since I was 14ï¼Œ which has deepened my awareness of my body and enhanced my ability to control it. I am often amazed by the power of the human body.

Karate is a combative sport that has taught me to face formidable opponents and embrace the possibility of pain, shaping me into a braver person.

Countless times during training and competitions I have reached the point of exhaustion, yet the encouragement of my friends pushed me to persevere at every moment.
